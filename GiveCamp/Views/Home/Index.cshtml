        <h1>What is GiveCamp?</h1>
        <p class="lead">GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where software developers, designers, database administrators and project managers donate their time to create custom software for non-profit organizations. This custom software could be a new website for the nonprofit organization, a small data-collection application to keep track of members, or a application for the Red Cross that automatically emails a blood donor three months after they’ve donated blood to remind them that they are now eligible to donate again. The only limitation is that the project should be scoped to be able to be completed in a weekend.</p>
        <p class="lead">At GiveCamp last year, in one weekend we were able to donate over 1/2 a million dollars worth of development time to over a dozen local charities.</p>
